## Fraud Detection

### Project Overview 

This is a project i did focuses on analyzing and visualizing credit card transactions to detect fraudulent activity. Using **Power BI**, I built an interactive dashboard that summarizes key fraud statistics, trends, and insights â€” helping users identify patterns and high-risk areas.

### Objectives

- Check and remove duplicate and errors and also check for the data type.
- Explore and compare fraudulent vs. non-fraudulent activity.
- Create DAX measures for fraud rates, statistical summaries, and filters.
- Visualize insights through dynamic and interactive charts.

### Tools Used

- **Power BI** for data modeling and visualization  
- **DAX** for custom measures and calculations for **FRAUD RATE**, **fraud and not fraud count**, **fraud mean,median,min,max**
- **VISUALS** for cards visual, clustered column chart, area chart, bar chart
